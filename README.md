# CalamityTV_CFD

We plan on creating a mobile (or web) appication, that notifies the user about any natural calamity (and steps for prevention), which may occur in the near future.

We plan to also allow reporting of disaster events. We plan on running some sort of validation to verify all events reported by the community.

We plan on creating our own API, for scraping data from another source (GDACS, USGS) for getting information regarding the calamity.
